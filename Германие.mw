Implementing the latest energy saving facilities
Energy efficient heat pumps for air conditioning facilities
Energy efficient heat pumps for air conditioning facilities	In its air conditioning facilities, Yamazaki Baking is installing heat pumps that use the air’s latent heat. The heat pumps achieve three to five times higher energy efficiency than conventional equipment that uses gas or steam. This represents a significant result in energy conservation. Yamazaki Baking has introduced the latest energy saving facilities to reduce its environmental impact in many aspects, including cogeneration systems that deliver improved heat and electric energy efficiency. The company is also committed to using cleaner alternative energy sources, and has introduced solar and wind power generation systems.
Implementing fuel-efficient and low emission vehicles 
Every day, Yamazaki Baking’s delivery vehicles take fresh products to its customers. Therefore the distribution is a major part of the company’s environmental efforts. The company is working to introduce fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicles such as hybrid vehicles and natural gas vehicles. In addition, the company has introduced a GPS-powerd traffic control system for its delivery vehicles to optimize delivery routes and thereby reduce the number of vehicles and delivery distances. It is also actively promoting environmentally conscious driving.	
Hybrid trucks reduce CO2 emissions by about 18% per vehicle compared with conventional trucks.
Hybrid trucks reduce CO2 emissions by about 18% per vehicle compared with conventional trucks.

Effective use of food resources
Yamazaki Baking regards the food byproducts that arise in the process of producing its products as a valuable resource. For example the crusts of bread are not required for some products, but by providing designated conveyor line and storage areas and managing quality appropriately, it is possible to reprocess the crusts as an ingredient in food products such as confectionaries and bread crumbs.
