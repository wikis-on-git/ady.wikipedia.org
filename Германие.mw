Yamaguchi-gumi Yamabishi.svg "Yamabishi" (山菱), the daimon of the Yamaguchi-gumi Founded 1915; 102 years ago Founder Harukichi Yamaguchi Founding location Kobe, Japan Years active 1915–present Territory Primarily based in Kobe but has territory all over Japan, including in Nagoya, Tokyo Membership (est.) 23,400[1] Leader(s) Kenichi Shinoda Criminal activities Arms trafficking, assassinations, bank fraud, bid rigging, blackmail, bookmaking, contract killing, extortion, drug trafficking, illegal gambling, Internet pornography, loansharking, mail fraud, match fixing, money laundering, mortgage fraud, murder, prostitution, racketeering, securities fraud, sōkaiya, wire fraud, and infiltration of legitimate businesses Allies Inagawa-kai Rivals Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi It is one of the largest criminal organizations in the world. According to the National Police Agency, it had 20,400 active members and 18,600 associated members in 2007.[3] It is, by far, the largest of the boryokudan groups, and its membership encompasses roughly 45% of the 86,300 yakuza in the Japanese underworld. Leading members of the Yamaguchi-gumi number 102 people in total; 1 kumichō (組長; boss), 15 shatei (舎弟; younger brother) and 86 wakachū (若中; child) as of November 2005.
The Yamaguchi-gumi are among the world's wealthiest gangsters, bringing in billions of dollars a year from extortion, gambling, the sex industry, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, real estate and construction kickback schemes. They are also involved in stock market manipulation and Internet pornography.
The Yamaguchi-gumi has its headquarters in Kobe, but it operates all across Japan and has overseas operations in the rest of Asia and the United States.[citation needed] Its current kumicho (Boss), Shinobu Tsukasa, has declared an expansionist policy—even making inroads into Tokyo, traditionally not Yamaguchi turf.[4] They also have multiple groups working overseas.[5][6]
Leadership Edit
1st kumicho (1915–1925): Harukichi Yamaguchi[4] 2nd kumicho (1925–1942): Noboru Yamaguchi—son of Harukichi Yamaguchi 3rd kumicho (1946–1981): Kazuo Taoka When Taoka inherited the title of kumicho, it was merely a local family with only a few dozen members. It was Taoka who made Yamaguchi-gumi the world's largest criminal organization. He urged his underlings to have legitimate businesses and allowed them to have their own family, which became a kind of subsidiary family of Yamaguchi-gumi. He also created a structural system in the family. Wakagashira were elected as underbosses to the kumicho and some of powerful members were elected as wakagashira-hosa (deputy underbosses).[citation needed]
4th kumicho (1984–1985): Masahisa Takenaka After the death of Taoka, the heir apparent wakagashira Kenichi Yamamoto (kumicho of the Yamaken-gumi) was serving a prison sentence. He died of liver failure shortly afterward. Fumiko Taoka, Kazuo Taoka's wife, stepped forward to fill the leadership void until a new kumicho could be selected by a council of eight top-level bosses. In 1984, the elders chose Masahisa Takenaka (kumicho of the Takenaka-gumi) to be the fourth kumicho of Yamaguchi-gumi. One of the other contenders, Hiroshi Yamamoto (kumicho of the Yamahiro-gumi), broke away from Yamaguchi-gumi with many of its powerful members and more than 3,000 of its soldiers to form the Ichiwa-kai. A bitter rivalry existed between the two groups, which led to an all-out war (the Yama-Ichi War) after the Ichiwa-kai's 1985 assassination of Takenaka and wakahashira Katsumasa Nakayama. During the war, acting-kumicho Kazuo Nakanishi (kumicho of the Nakanishi-gumi) and wakagashira Yoshinori Watanabe (kumicho of the Yamaken-gumi) briefly took the leadership role until 1989.
5th kumicho (1989–2005): Yoshinori Watanabe The Yama-Ichi War ended with retirement of Hiroshi Yamamoto which was arbitrated by one of the most respected bosses Seijo Inagawa. After that, the clan elected wakagashira Yoshinori Watanabe as 5th kumicho of the organization. Masaru Takumi (kumicho of Takumi-gumi) was elected as wakagashira. He was so powerful and respected within the organization that his influence overshadowed that of kumicho to some extent.
6th kumicho (2005–present): Shinobu Tsukasa (real name: Kenichi Shinoda)[4] In 1997, then powerful wakagashira Masaru Takumi was assassinated by underlings of then wakagashira-hosa (deputy underboss) Taro Nakano. After this assassination, they were unable to choose a new wakagashira for more than eight years. As a result, leadership of the organization became weaker. Finally, in 2005, wakagashira-hosa Shinobu Tsukasa (then kumicho of the Hirota-gumi) was chosen as new wakagashira and shortly afterward, in August 2005, Tsukasa inherited the position of the 6th kumicho of the Yamaguchi-gumi.
Watanabe retired to private life—rather uncommon in Yakuza circles, as bosses usually do not retire until their death.[7] Under Tsukasa's leadership, the 6th Yamaguchi-gumi has resumed expansion. Kiyoshi Takayama, kumicho of the Kodo-kai, was elected as wakagashira. They absorbed the Tokyo-based gang Kokusui-kai, thus acquiring lucrative turf in the capital. Tsukasa was imprisoned in December 2005 for illegal gun possession, and was released in April 2011 after serving nearly six years in jail.[8][9]

Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong Un (Chosŏn'gŭl: 김정은; Korean pronunciation: [kim.dzʌŋ.ɯn] or [kim.tsʌŋ.ɯn]; born 8 January 1982–84 or 5 July 1984)[4] is the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and supreme leader of North Korea. Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui.[7] Before taking power, Kim was rarely seen in public, and many of the activities of Kim and his government remain unknown.[8] Even details such as what year he was born, and whether he did indeed attend a Western school under a pseudonym, are difficult to confirm.

Imagine you are Sachin Walia, you are living at 517-L, Model Town, Phagwara. Write a letter of complaint to the executive officer of the Municipality inviting his attention towards the insanitary condition in your locality.

517-L, Model Town,

Phagwara.

August 25, 20…


 
To

            The Executive Officer,

            Municipal Council,

            Phagwara.

Sir,

            I wish to draw your attention to the insanitary condition in your locality.

            This locality has been neglected for long. There are so many pots which remain full of water in the rainy season. It becomes difficult to cross the road at night. Mosquitoes breed in the standing water. It is feared that some epidemic will break out. The so-called Disco fever has already told upon the health of the people.

            The drains are not cleaned every day. The rubbish is dumped in the middle of the street. Flies keep buzzing throughout the day. Dung-heaps are not removed for days. The sweeper turns a deaf ear to the requests made to him. The Sanitary Inspector is a stranger to this locality.

             It is, therefore, requested that the sanitary staff be instructed to take necessary steps in the matter.

It will be appreciated if you take a round of this locality.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

Sachin Walia.

Insanitary condition

Sania Naveed
Karachi

Through the esteemed columns of your newspaper, I would like to draw the attentions of relevant authorities towards the bad and poor condition of cleanliness and drain system of our town. The streets are not swept regularly. The cleaner has disappeared since two months. The piles of garbage can be seen everywhere in our society. Bad smell is arising from these refuses which cannot be bored by residents. These refuses have blocked the drain system in bad way. Drain water is overflowing from gutters. This water has turned into many pounds. Condition of road has spoiled, especially pedestrians cannot cross road and face a lot troubles.
This bad system is generating many fatal diseases. Flies are found immensely and it is helping to the growth of mosquitoes. Malaria has broken out and two persons have gone to bed due to malaria fever. We are worried about the spread of dengue and cholera. If this state of affairs continues for a few more days, there is every likelihood of losing many bodies. I request that this matter should be taken in hand seriously by municipal authorities. Some immediate steps must be taken to stop this grim issue so that people can live comfortably. I am looking forward for prompt response in this matter.

Este é um canal de comunicação entre você e a Ouvidoria da Anvisa. Você pode fazer denúncias, reclamações e solicitações pertinentes à vigilância sanitária.  

Orientações sobre denúncias: sigilo e anonimato

A Ouvidoria dá prioridade para denúncias e reclamações, mas também recebe e acompanha pedidos de informação, sugestões, solicitações e elogios.

Para a Ouvidoria da Anvisa, as denúncias sem a identificação do denunciante são consideradas anônimas. Essas denúncias só serão aceitas após a análise preliminar da Ouvidoria e a confirmação de indícios de veracidade, o que é condição fundamental para iniciar o processo de investigação. No entanto, a falta de dados do denunciante impossibilita uma resposta final da Ouvidoria e pode dificultar ou inviabilizar a conclusão desse processo.

Diferente das anônimas, as denúncias sigilosas são aquelas em que os dados de identificação do denunciante são mantidos em sigilo. Para que a Ouvidoria garanta esse direito, é preciso que o denunciante solicite ou marque a opção de confidencialidade ao preencher o formulário do Anvis@tende ou do Folder Postal. Todas as denúncias sigilosas são aceitas e investigadas. Para isso, informe o máximo de dados possível ao cadastrar sua manifestação e se identifique corretamente. Desta forma, sua demanda poderá ser analisada com mais eficiência, além de garantir uma resposta no final do processo.
